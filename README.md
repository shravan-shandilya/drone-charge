# drone-charge

This is an attempt to build a network of autonomous charging stations for autonomous vehicles.The project is being done as a part of cohort 4 of thingQbator (an IoT incubator at Cisco). 
When the autonomous vehicles becomes widely adopted,we need to have a autonomous network of charging stations to keep them running with no human interaction involved.The idea is to create such a transparent,scalable system on top of blockchain infrastructure.This is currently being experimented on Drones.
